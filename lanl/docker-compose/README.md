# Deployment Recipe for use with Docker compose

1. Run the `generate-creds.sh` script to generate a `.env` file populated with
   randomly-generated passwords for each Postgres database. This file will be
   read by Docker Compose.
1. Run:

   ```
   docker compose -f ochami-services.yml -f ochami-krakend-ce.yml up
   ```

   to bring up ochami services.
1. After a minute or so you can check the health of SMD:

   ```
   curl http://<smd_host>:27779/hsm/v2/service/ready
   ```
1. And BSS:

   ```
   curl http://<bss_host>:27778/boot/v1/service/status
   ```

### Running Hurl Tests

The hurl tests use [Hurl](https://hurl.dev/) to send API calls to SMD and BSS to
perform integration testing. `ochami-hurl-tests.yml` depends on
`ochami-services.yml`, so run the tests with:

```
docker compose -f ochami-services.yml -f ochami-hurl-tests.yml up
```

### Note on ochami-init errors

Docker compose doesn't dispose of ephemeral volumes unless you run

```
docker compose -f ochami-services.yml -f ochami-krakend-ce.yml -f hydra.yml down --volumes
```

Try disposing of the volumes if you're seeing an error that looks something like
this:

```
ochami-init      | time="2024-01-23T17:58:49Z" level=fatal msg="pq: role \"smd-init-user\" already exists"
postgres         | 2024-01-23 17:58:49.664 UTC [26] ERROR:  role "smd-init-user" already exists
```
